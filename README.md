**Patent**: An innovation is protected by a patent. It encourages innovation and facilitates scientific and technological progress. A patent is an **exclusive right** awarded for an invention, which is a product or a technique that, in general, gives a new technological solution to a problem or provides a new way of doing something. According to the provisions of the patent, others are **prohibited** from creating, using, selling, proposing to sell, or importing the patented invention in a certain region. Once granted, the awarded patent must  be kept up to date for the duration of its **life cycle**, which is **20 years** from the date of the first filing. During a patent dispute, **claims** are used to specify the patent's **scope**.

**Copyright** : safeguards the uniqueness of literary and creative expression.

**Trademark** : is a symbol that identifies the source of products and services and differentiates them from those of others. It's not only about words, labels, or logos. A sound or a three-dimensional mark might be used.

**Designs** : The term "design" refers to any aesthetic or decorative (non-functional) feature of a product's outward appearance that appeals to the eye rather than its purposes. Designs must be fresh or considered `original`.

**Trade Secret** : Formal company methods, technological processes, customer lists and profiles, business plans, algorithms, marketing techniques, and the accumulation of information that is not commonly known to the public are all examples of trade secrets. Trade secrets provide the owner with a competitive edge and should not be exposed. All trade secrets are classified as confidential information.

**Confidential Information** : might include any information about the organization that is not available to the general public, such as compensation, performance evaluations, and any other personal information about the personnel. Patents are also considered sensitive information. Patents that are filed are kept secret from the public for a certain amount of time until they are published, during which time the material remains confidential. So, we ought to keep in mind, if secret material must be given, a signed Non-Disclosure Agreement must be in place.
